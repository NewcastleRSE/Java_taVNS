# Java_taVNS

## Getting started

To run this program you need OpenJDK 17 or later (or equivalent) installed on 
your computer.

The simplest way to get going would be to create a directory called Java_taVNS 
somewhere where you will find it again. If you know what you are doing you can call this
directory whatever you want but for this documentation we will stick to
**Java_taVNS**.

From GitHub download the latest release of the software. In a browser navigate to
https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/Java_taVNS. Under **Releases** click on the release
marked as **Latest**. Right-click the .jar file and "Save as" into the 
**Java_taVNS** directory. Right-click the .bat file and "Save as" into the
**Java_taVNS** directory.

To run the program just double left-click the run.bat file.

The first time you run this program it will create a subdirectory called 
**.Java_taVNS** in your user directory. It will also create two files called
**system.properties** and **default.protocol**.

**default.protocol** is used to set default values in the Stimulation Protocol 
section. Everytime you start the program these values will be loaded into this 
section. However, you can change the settings and save them back to default if
you prefer different default values. To do that, change the values as needed
and then click the **Replace** button. **Replace** will overwrite whatever
protocol is selected in the Protocol combobox at the time. If you want to save
your values under a different name then click on the **Save as** button. You will
be prompted for a name. This name will be added to the combobox for selection.
